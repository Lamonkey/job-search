## Experience

**Software Developer**
  : **Acme Corp**
  : **Feb 2024 - Jul 2025**

- Designed, developed, and maintained **scalable backend services** using **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, Next.js, Python, and React to backup, process, and analyze large-scale messaging data for end users
- Built **event-driven services** using a queue-based **producer/consumer** workflow (SQS-style, comparable to **Apache Kafka** message processing), with **error handling**, **retry strategies**, and dead-letter routing to ensure reliable message delivery
- Implemented on-demand background processing using **cloud-native** orchestration (AWS Fargate), automatically scaling workers to process long-running jobs and storing results durably in S3 for **high availability and reliability**
- Built and maintained a backend web service exposing **RESTful APIs** to proxy, monitor, and meter LLM requests, enabling usage-based billing, request throttling, and efficient handling of I/O-bound workloads
- Implemented **structured logging**, **metrics collection**, and operational **dashboards** to monitor request latency, throughput, and error rates, enabling **root cause analysis** and faster resolution of **production incidents**
- Profiled and optimized database read/write paths by replacing row-by-row operations with batched queries, achieving up to **10x throughput improvement** under high-volume workloads
- Participated in **Agile/Scrum** ceremonies and contributed to **Git-based workflows** including **pull requests** and **code reviews**

**Full Stack Developer**
  : **Beta Analytics**
  : **Feb 2023 - Feb 2024**

- Designed and built a component-based Python analytics system for financial portfolio analysis, separating compute-intensive services from user-facing **RESTful API** endpoints
- Implemented scheduled background jobs for data ingestion, backtesting, and portfolio recalculation, orchestrated using **Kubernetes**
- Provisioned and managed cloud infrastructure on **AWS** and **Microsoft Azure** using **Terraform**, defining compute resources in a reproducible **infrastructure-as-code** workflow
- Supported **CI/CD pipelines** and **deployment automation** using infrastructure-as-code practices
- Troubleshot **production issues** by analyzing logs and metrics, improving backtesting accuracy by approximately **10%**
- Collaborated cross-functionally in an **Agile** environment

## Projects

**Gamma — AI-Powered Platform**

- Built and maintained a **cloud-native** application using Flask and React, adopted by dozens of organizations and used by thousands of users; co-founded the product and owned design and implementation end-to-end
- Built a knowledge-guided reasoning layer using **LangChain** and **ChromaDB** to retrieve domain-specific expertise
- Integrated external ML and LLM APIs using a **Redis + Celery + ThreadPool** concurrency model optimized for I/O-bound workloads

**Delta Stream Analyzer — Real-Time Event-Driven Analytics**

- Designed and built an **event-driven architecture** ingesting high-volume event streams using **Kafka-style** producer/consumer patterns
- Exposed aggregation results through **RESTful** and **GraphQL APIs**
- Containerized analytics workloads with **Docker** and designed deployments compatible with **Kubernetes**
